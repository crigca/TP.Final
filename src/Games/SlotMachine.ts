        === Slot Machine Rules ===

        1. Place your bet.
        2. The reels will spin and stop on random symbols.
        3. If you get a winning combination on the payline, youâ€™ll receive a prize based on your bet and the symbol values.

        === Winning Combinations ===

        - Three matching symbols (e.g., 3 hearts) award a prize of x3.
        - Two matching symbols (e.g., 2 hearts) award an additional x2 prize.

        === Prizes ===

        - The prize depends on the bet amount.
        - Each symbol has its own value, which also affects the prize.

        Good luck!`;
